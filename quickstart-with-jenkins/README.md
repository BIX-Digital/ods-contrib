# Quickstart with Jenkins

The aim of this shell script is to enable the testing of changes in the quickstarters without relying on provisioning app.

### PREREQUISITE
Before you can run this script, you need to have an OpenShift project generated by the provisioning app.

### WHAT THIS SCRIPT DOES IN A NUTSHELL
Here're some important steps of the script:
- Selecting your OpenShift project
- Creating a Bitbucket repository under your ODS project
- Generating a Webhook for the repo
- Generating a pipeline
- Running the pipeline

Let's say you would like to add a new component `bar` to your project `foo`. You are going to use quickstarter `be-node-express`. However you'd like to customize it by modifying `ods-quickstarters`. There, you check out a new branch `my-test-branch` to make your changes. To test them, you can run this script as below to generate your customized `be-node-express` component `bar`:
```
sh ./run.sh \
  --username="your_email" \
  --project-id="foo" \
  --component-id=bar” \
  --quickstarter=“be-node-express” \
  --ods-image-tag=2.x \
  --quickstarter-branch="my-test-branch" \
  --shared-lib-branch=2.x
```

> **_NOTE:_** Its noteworthy to mention we have some optional parameters `quickstarter-repo`, `group-id` and `package-name`.


If you're confused about the syntax of the script arguments, you can check by running: `sh ./run.sh -h`
