# Quickstart with Jenkins

The aim of this shell script is to enable the testing of changes in the quickstarters without relying on provisioning app.

## PREREQUISITE

Before you can run this script, you need to have an OpenShift project generated by the provisioning app and be logged in via oc CLI in your terminal.

## WHAT THIS SCRIPT DOES IN A NUTSHELL

Here're some important steps of the script:

- Selecting your OpenShift project
- Creating a Bitbucket repository under your ODS project
- Generating a Webhook for the repo
- Generating a pipeline
- Running the pipeline

Let's say you would like to add a new component `bar` to your project `foo`. You are going to use quickstarter `inf-terraform-aws`. However you'd like to customize it by modifying `ods-quickstarters` that you have forked in another bitbucket project called `my-ods`. There, you check out a new branch `4.x` to make your changes. To test them, you can run this script as below to generate your customized `inf-terraform-aws` component `bar`:

```bash
sh ./run.sh --project-id="foo" \
  --component-id="bar" \
  --quickstarter="inf-terraform-aws" \
  --shared-library-git-ref=4.x \
  --agent-image-tag=4.x \
  --bitbucket-repo-name=bar-awsqs \
  --ods-bitbucket-project=my-ods \
  --quickstarter-git-ref=4.x
```

> **_NOTE 1:_** It's noteworthy to mention to please take a closer look into the default parameters.

> **_NOTE 2:_** It's recommended to use a bitbucket token instead of your password when requested.

If you're confused about the syntax of the script arguments, you can check by running: `sh ./run.sh -h`
